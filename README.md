# AirBnB_clone
####Step 1: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

Each task is linked and will help to:
-put in place a parent class(BaseModel)
-create a simple flow of serialization/ deserialization
-create all classes used for Airbnb
-create the first abstracted storage engine of the roject
-crreate all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
